# To-Do List Project

## Overview

This is a simple **To-Do List** application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to:

- **Add tasks** to the list.
- **Delete individual tasks**.
- **Mark tasks as done**.
- **Clear the entire list** of tasks.

This project demonstrates how to work with basic **DOM manipulation**.
## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Allows the user to add a new task to the list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Delete individual tasks by clicking a "Delete" button next to each task.
- **Mark Tasks as Done**: Users can mark tasks as complete with a checkbox. Completed tasks are visually crossed out.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Users can clear all tasks from the list with a "Clear All" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure of the To-Do List.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the app, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the appâ€™s interactivity, such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks.

## How to Run

## Future Improvements
